            <h2>Dreaming the Shearer's Dream - our past</h2>
            <p class="blurb">The seventies and early eighties saw an Australian folk music revival and a resurgence of Australian bush music powered by the pioneering work of John Meredith, John Manifold and Bill Scott and nowhere was the scene more lively than Sydney.
                Shearer's Dream, in close association with the Bush Music Club, was among the bands building on that tradition of helping Australians get to know and love their own cultural traditions. The band played hundreds of bush dances and concerts
                around Sydney between 1981 and 1985 at a wide variety of venues such as the Three Weeds in Rozelle, The Governors Pleasure in The Rocks and at weddings and school halls across the city.</p>

            <p class="blurb" id="gig">1984 was the last year all five of us played together as a band but since then, every member of the band has been playing music in one form or another. From left to right in the photo from1984 are; Campbell Atkins (CJ Atkins), Doug Jenner
                (Rory Sweatperson), Kristina Took (Mandy Lin), Peter Jenner (Carlton Foster) and Bernard O'Connor (Michael Connor - his stage name). As a band we didn't restrict ourselves to bush dances and we were very much at home as a pub band. This
                gig will reflect that our penchant for singing in addition to the dance tunes. At the Petersham Bowlo we will be celebrating those early musical days with some drinks and even more laughs ... then more drinks.</p>

                <p><img src="Assets/Bernard.jpg" class="biophoto" alt="Picture of Bernard playing a mandolin" height=30% width=30%></p>
                <p>After leaving Shearer's Draem, Bernard thought that he would learn how to fiddle. Five minutes later he joined the mighty "Ragged Band" with the legendary Karl Myriad. They played bush dances all over NSW and were the resident bushies
                    at the Mean Fiddler (now called the Fiddler). He then strolled down to The Rocks and took up with a group of renegades knowl at "Green Jam" just for fun. He played with Green Jam for over 10 years with a residency at that lovely old
                    pub The Hero of Waterloo. Bernard then started an Irish group called "No Messin" which later became a more serious folk group called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chippodays/">"Chippo Days"</a> Chippo Days draws from the rich
                    traditions of Irish, Scottish and English folk, American Old Time music, gospel, a touch of bluegrass, the blues, jazz, Australian bush music, a little bit of good ol’ rock n’ roll. It plays their own original songs and tunes, Chippo
                    Days brings a fresh and modern sensibility to the folk and roots sounds. In this group, Bernard collaborates with his partner Sara-Jane </a>.</p>

                <p> Bernard and Sara-Jane are now also collaborating in a new group called Folk 17. Folk 17 is a reference to a club in Greece where Bernard used to entertain hippie travellers - as well as being a a reminder that we Australians - and therefore
                    our folk music - is a mixture of many many different cultures, influences and traditions.

                <p>After Shearer’s Dream, Kris Took joined a bush band in Camden called Coachwood. One member of Coachwood was the famous banjo player Alan Healy who also played with Sons of Rosin and now has a group called The Hooleys. Kris currently plays
                    in folk band called Stringline. Band members Kris, Paul and Paula plays some traditional Irish and bluegrass tunes, sings some traditional songs and ‘Stringline’ them to get a unique sound of harmonies and blended instruments of violin,
                    mandolins, banjo and guitar. Stringline performs a number of original songs and have written a piece about the tragic Aboriginal massacre in Appin, 200 years ago as well as some other pieces with catchy tunes and contemporary topics.
                    They enjoy performing at folk festivals and have performed at Gulgong, Camden and Crookwell. They also enjoy open mics and music sessions in and the around the Southern Highlands.
