            <h2>Dreaming the Shearer's Dream - our past</h2>
              <p>The seventies and early eighties saw an Australian folk music revival and a resurgence of Australian bush music powered by the pioneering work of John Meredith, John Manifold and Bill Scott and nowhere was the scene more lively than Sydney. Shearer's Dream, in close association with the Bush Music Club, was among the bands building on that tradition of helping Australians get to know and love their own cultural traditions. The band played hundreds of bush dances and concerts around Sydney between 1981 and 1985 at a wide variety of venues such as the Three Weeds in Rozelle, The Governors Pleasure in The Rocks and at weddings and school halls across the city.</p>

              <p>1984 was the last year all five of us played together as a band but since then, every member of the band has been playing music in one form or another. From left to right in the photo from1984 are; Campbell Atkins (CJ Atkins), Doug Jenner (Rory Sweatperson), Kristina Took (Mandy Lin), Peter Jenner (Carlton Foster) and Bernard O'Connor (Michael Connor For Tax Purposes). As a band we didn't restrict ourselves to bush dances and we were very much at home as a pub band. This gig will reflect that our penchant for singing in addition to the dance tunes. At the Petersham Bowlo we will be celebrating those early musical days with some drinks and even more laughs ... then more drinks.</p>
