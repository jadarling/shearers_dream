  <h1>Bernard O'Connor</h1>
  <p>After leaving Shearer's Draem, Bernard thought that he would learn how to fiddle. Five minutes later he joined the mighty "Ragged Band" with the legendary Karl Myriad.  They played bush dances all over NSW and were the resident bushies at the Mean Fiddler (now called the Fiddler). He then strolled down to The Rocks and took up with a group of renegades knowl at "Green Jam" just for fun.  He played with Green Jam for over 10 years with a residency at that lovely old pub The Hero of Waterloo.  Bernard then started an Irish group called "No Messin" which later became a more serious folk group called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chippodays/">"Chippo Days"</a> Chippo Days draws from the rich traditions of Irish, Scottish and English folk, American Old Time music, gospel, a touch of bluegrass, the blues, jazz, Australian bush music, a little bit of good ol’ rock n’ roll.  It plays their own original songs and tunes, Chippo Days brings a fresh and modern sensibility to the folk and roots sounds. In this group, Bernard collaborates with his partner Sara-Jane </a>.</p>

  <p>  Bernard and Sara-Jane are now also collaborating in a new group called Folk 17.  Folk 17 is:
    <ul>
      <li>a reference to a club in Greece where Bernard used to entertain hippie travellers; </li>
      <li> a reminder that we Australians - and therefore our folk music - is a mixture of many many different cultures, influences and traditions.
    </ul>
